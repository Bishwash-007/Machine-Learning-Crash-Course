    "# Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels. It can be categorized into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification**: Predicting a discrete label.\n",
    "2. **Regression**: Predicting a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps in supervised learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather labeled data.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data.\n",
    "3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate algorithm.\n",
    "4. **Training**: Train the model on the training data.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on test data.\n",
    "6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common algorithms used in supervised learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- Neural Networks\n",

    "Supervised learning is widely used in various applications such as spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis."
